I am a recent graduate of the University of California, Irvine, where I received my Masters of Science in Business Analytics. Prior to studying at UCI, I majored in Statistics at the University of California, Berkeley, where I graduated in 2020. At Cal I primarily studied sampling theory, linear modeling, and experimental design. I built upon these skills in the MSBA Program at UCI, where I focused on a data analytics track within the program.

Outside of studying and attending class, I primarily spend time with my friends, family, and my wonderful girlfriend Jenna. We enjoy going camping in the desert, exploring San Diego and Orange County, and finding great new places to eat. When we're not out doing any of those things, we're probably watching the greatest show on television, *The Mandalorian*, or just spending time together.

In addition to all of that, my father and I have been restoring our 1969 Ford Bronco. If I'm not in class or with Jenna, I'm most likely working on the Bronco. It has the original Ford 302, Wild Horses shorty headers, a 1" body lift and a 2.5" suspension lift. Last year we broke the original Dana 30 front axle while on the trail in Big Bear with So Cal Broncos, so we upgraded to a stronger Dana 44; an additional plus is that I now have front disk brakes! We just finished putting the original 3 on the tree transmission back in it, and we're really looking forward to wheeling this *mostly* stock Bronco.
